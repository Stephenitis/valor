[Discretion](http://ss-discretion.sourceforge.net) is the better part of:

# Valor

Subspace game written in Elm (Haskell -> FRP -> (HTML,CSS,JS)).

# Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile (or Makefile), Version, or History. (If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself -- I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
