[Discretion](http://ss-discretion.sourceforge.net) is the better part of:

# Valor

I honestly don't know how to go about this but here's what I've found out so far:

* Discretion is built with [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/)
* Some awesome person that looks like they're from around Santa Barbara (where @perplexes lives) has a [port of SDL to the iPhone](http://code.google.com/p/iphone-sdl-1-3/): [here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th3__8ozNz0)
* ???
* PROFIT, and by profit, I mean release it under GPL and put on iPhone for FREE! Yay for [MMOGs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massively_multiplayer_online_games)!

So hey, if you want to help, fork and send pull requests our way.

# Contributing
(from @jamedaniels)

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile (or Makefile), Version, or History. (If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself -- I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
